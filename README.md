Asteroids is another classic arcade video game that was released in 1979 by Atari Inc. It was designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh. Similar to Space Invaders, Asteroids is considered one of the most significant and influential games of its era.

In Asteroids, the player controls a triangular spaceship that is situated in the middle of the screen. The objective of the game is to destroy asteroids and other enemy spacecraft while avoiding collisions with them. The game is set in space, and the screen wraps around, meaning that objects that move off one side of the screen reappear on the opposite side.

The player's spaceship is equipped with a limited supply of ammunition and has the ability to rotate left or right, thrust forward, and fire projectiles. The asteroids on the screen are randomly positioned and vary in size. When shot, a large asteroid breaks into smaller pieces that are more difficult to destroy. The player must navigate through the debris and avoid getting hit. Additionally, there are enemy UFOs that appear intermittently and pose a threat to the player.

Asteroids features simple yet challenging gameplay, requiring the player to demonstrate precision in movement and shooting. The game does not have a traditional ending or levels; instead, the difficulty gradually increases as the player destroys more asteroids. The player's score increases with each asteroid destroyed, and the game continues until the player loses all their lives.
